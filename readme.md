# Quick-Phone-Media-Transfer

With new Android SD card formatting it can be hard to transfer photos and media off your phone to your PC and transferring media off iOS platforms restricted to one computer can also be time consuming.
This application lets you run a server by opening a single file on your computer and then using your phone to go to that ip address and uploading selected files

### Instructions
* (Optional) On your mobile or external device download an app like File Manager and navigate to your DCIM folder where your media is stored and zip the folder you want to transfer
* On your computer run the exe file and accept any security prompts, all Go servers have this same prompt.
* Open command prompt and type in ipconfig or unix alternative,
then under Wireless LAN adapter Wi-Fi get your IPv4 Address.
* Open your ip address appended with /backupnow on your phone
* Click the zip file or select individual files
* The files should then be transferred to the downloads folder
